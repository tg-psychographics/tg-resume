<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hey there! I'm Tanya. At 45, I proudly juggle the roles of a devoted mother to three incredible individuals 
  and a passionate explorer in the realm of tech. Growing up alongside a Software Engineer brother, I was always 
  drawn to the enchanting world of technology. Over the years, I've cultivated a wealth of self-taught expertise 
  in navigating PCs and troubleshooting tech snags.</p>

<p>For the past seven years, I've immersed myself in the captivating world of Graphic Design, shaping brands
  and ideas into visually compelling stories. As a Social Media Manager, I've helped businesses craft their
  online narratives, harnessing the power of digital platforms to connect and engage.</p>

<p>Around five years ago, I fell head over heels for the limitless possibilities of web development. It ignited
   a fire within me, propelling me to dive deeper into the realms of HTML, CSS, and Java. I've even coded my very 
   own "Coming Soon Page" complete with a snazzy countdown timer integrated, a proud testament to my journey into 
   this dynamic field.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm on an exhilarating learning path, pursuing certification as a Full-Stack Web Developer through
  online studies. With a solid foundation in HTML and a sprinkle of CSS and Java know-how, I'm ardently devoted
  to mastering the intricate tapestry of web development by the year's end!</p>
